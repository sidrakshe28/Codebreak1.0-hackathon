In today’s world water, a vital resource required for sustaining life is becoming scarce, which is
leading to an impure water supply and water shortages. To prevent this, not only are water
preservation techniques like rainwater harvesting required, but also water wastage must be
prevented. 

Humans are a selfish species who give money making the highest priority. Our solution innovatively
quenches the thirst for money and conserves water.
There are 326 million trillion gallons of water on earth. 97% is salt water and undrinkable. 2.5% is
fresh water, but most of this is trapped in the poles or deep underground. This leaves us with roughly
0.4% to share amongst 7 billion people and even more livestock .
User needs to install a big tank to store the the harvested water.

Most of the times harvested water gets left unused or there is lack of harvested water.
So as to more efficiently manage the water harvesting system we are automating all the water
transfer using different sensors.

Using blockchain we have made a transparent system which anyone can monitor.
Credits are added to your system for every amount of water contributed which can be used later.

#### Our prototype is divided into 3 parts :

* 1. TANK 1 (water harvester)-
     Ultrasonic sensors- checking water level.
     Flow sensors- checking quantity of water sent to Central tank.
* 2. TANK 2 (storing water)-
     Ultrasonic sensors:- Automatically filling when needed.
* 3. Central tank (stores water and distributes water when needed)-
     Flow sensors- checking the quantity of water used.

Blockchain solves the problems of unfair water distribution and monopolies, we need more
transparency. Blockchain technology plans to provide water transparency on a massive scale
Blockchain is a secure, transparent and distributed public ledger that records transactions between
parties.
Blockchain removes this single point of failure in an IoT system, by enabling device networks to
protect themselves in other ways. The collaboration between blockchain and IoT water network
changes the way we manage water, without compromising our safety..
Thus by using our system we have made a more efficient way to utilize the water resources and
avoid its wastage by automating using IOT and making a transparent system, free from corruption
using blockchain.
